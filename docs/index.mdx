If you've used Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini to write code, you know the problem: the agent rewrites half your files, you're not sure what changed, and your working branch is a mess. Rolling back means cherry-picking through diffs. Running multiple agents on different tasks means juggling terminal sessions and hoping they don't step on each other.

Vibe Kanban gives every task its own git worktree — a dedicated branch and directory that's completely isolated from your main branch and from every other task. You describe what you want, the agent builds it, and you review the result as a clean diff. If you like it, open a PR. If you don't, delete the worktree. Your repo was never touched.

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```
