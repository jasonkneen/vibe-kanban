Issues are the individual work items in your project - bugs to fix, features to build, tasks to complete. Each issue lives on your kanban board and can be assigned to team members, tagged, prioritised, and tracked through your workflow.

## What is an Issue?

An **issue** represents a single piece of work. It has:

- **Title** - A short description of what needs to be done
- **Description** - Detailed information, requirements, or context
- **Status** - Which column it's in (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- **Priority** - How urgent it is (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- **Assignees** - Who's responsible for the work
- **Tags** - Labels for categorisation and filtering
- **Simple ID** - A unique identifier like `TASK-123` for easy reference


## Creating Issues

### From a Column

To create an issue in a specific column:

1. Click the **+** button at the top of any status column
2. The New Issue panel opens with that status pre-selected
3. Fill in the issue details and click **Create Task**

### From the Header

To create an issue using the header button:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/header-add-button.png" alt="Header showing the + button next to status tabs for creating a new issue" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the create panel">
  Click the **+** button in the header next to the status tabs.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter the title">
  Type a clear, descriptive title. The title field is focused automatically.
</Step>

<Step title="Set the status">
  Choose which column the issue should start in.
</Step>

<Step title="Set priority (optional)">
  Select a priority level (default is no priority):

  | Priority | When to Use |
  |----------|-------------|
  | **Urgent** | Needs immediate attention, blocking other work |
  | **High** | Important, should be done soon |
  | **Medium** | Normal priority |
  | **Low** | Nice to have, can wait |
</Step>

<Step title="Assign team members (optional)">
  Click the assignee field and select one or more team members. You can assign multiple people to the same issue.
</Step>

<Step title="Add tags (optional)">
  Select tags to categorise the issue. Tags help with filtering and organisation.
</Step>

<Step title="Add description (optional)">
  Write a detailed description using the rich text editor. You can format text, add lists, code blocks, and links.
</Step>

<Step title="Create the issue">
  Click **Create Task** to save the issue. The issue will appear on the board in the selected status column.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Create with Workspace

If you want to immediately start working on an issue with AI assistance:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "400px"}} src="/images/cloud/issue-create-form.png" alt="New Issue panel showing Create draft workspace immediately toggle" />
</Frame>

1. When creating an issue, enable **Create draft workspace immediately**
2. The issue is created with a linked [workspace](/workspaces/index)
3. You can start working with coding agents right away

See [Workspaces](/workspaces/index) to learn more about working with coding agents.

## Editing Issues

### Opening an Issue

Click any issue card on the board to open the issue panel. The panel slides in from the right side.


### Auto-Save

Changes to the title and description **save automatically** as you type. You don't need to click a save button - just edit and your changes are saved.

<Info>
Auto-save has a small delay (about half a second) to avoid saving every keystroke. If you close the panel immediately after typing, wait a moment for the save to complete.
</Info>

### Editing Properties

Properties like status, priority, assignees, and tags save **immediately** when you change them:

| Property | How to Edit |
|----------|-------------|
| **Status** | Click the status dropdown and select a new status, or drag the card to another column |
| **Priority** | Click the priority dropdown and select a level |
| **Assignees** | Click the assignees field, select/deselect team members |
| **Tags** | Click the tags field, select/deselect tags |

### Editing the Description

The description uses a rich text editor with formatting options:

- **Bold**, *italic*, ~~strikethrough~~
- Bullet lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks for technical content
- Links to external resources


## Issue Sections

The issue panel has collapsible sections for additional information:

### Workspaces Section

Shows development workspaces linked to this issue. Workspaces are where coding agents do their work.


- **Create Workspace** - Start a new workspace for this issue
- **Open Workspace** - Continue working in an existing workspace
- **View Status** - See if the workspace is active, idle, or completed

### Sub-Issues Section

Issues can have child issues (subtasks) for breaking down work:


- **Add Sub-Issue** - Create a new child issue
- **Link Existing Issue** - Make an existing issue a subtask
- **View Parent** - If this is a sub-issue, see its parent

### Comments Section

Discussion thread for the issue:


- **Add Comment** - Share updates, ask questions, or provide feedback
- **React** - Add emoji reactions to comments
- **Edit/Delete** - Modify or remove your own comments

## Sub-Issues (Subtasks)

Break large issues into smaller, manageable pieces using sub-issues.

### Creating a Sub-Issue

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the parent issue">
  Click the issue that will be the parent.
</Step>

<Step title="Expand the Sub-Issues section">
  Click the **Sub-Issues** section header to expand it.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Add Sub-Issue">
  Click the **+ Add Sub-Issue** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter sub-issue details">
  Fill in the title and any other details. The sub-issue is automatically linked to the parent.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Viewing the Parent Issue

When viewing a sub-issue, you'll see a **Parent** link at the top of the panel. Click it to navigate to the parent issue.

### Sub-Issue Behaviour

- Sub-issues appear on the board just like regular issues
- They can have their own status, priority, and assignees
- Completing all sub-issues doesn't automatically complete the parent
- Sub-issues can't have their own sub-issues (only one level deep)

## Copying Issue Links

To share an issue with someone:

1. Open the issue panel
2. Click the **Copy Link** button (<Icon icon="link" />) in the panel header
3. The issue URL is copied to your clipboard

Share this link with team members - they can click it to go directly to that issue.

## Deleting Issues

To delete an issue:

1. Open the issue panel
2. Click the **More** menu (<Icon icon="ellipsis" />)
3. Select **Delete Issue**
4. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
Deleting an issue is permanent. The issue, its comments, and its history are removed. Sub-issues are not deleted - they become standalone issues.
</Warning>

## Issue Simple IDs

Every issue has a **Simple ID** - a short, unique identifier like `TASK-123`. This makes it easy to reference issues in conversations, commits, and documentation.

The Simple ID is shown:
- On issue cards on the board
- In the issue panel header
- In the URL when viewing an issue

<Tip>
Use Simple IDs in commit messages (e.g., "Fix login bug TASK-123") to create a clear connection between code and issues.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Write clear titles" icon="heading">
  Issue titles should describe what needs to be done, not the problem. "Add password reset flow" is better than "Users can't reset password".
</Card>

<Card title="Use priority wisely" icon="flag">
  Reserve "Urgent" for genuine emergencies. If everything is urgent, nothing is.
</Card>

<Card title="Assign deliberately" icon="user">
  Assign issues to people who will actually work on them. Unassigned issues are fine for backlog items.
</Card>

<Card title="Keep descriptions updated" icon="file-lines">
  As requirements change or you learn more, update the description. It's the source of truth for what needs to be done.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
