---

Connect your GitHub repositories to Vibe Kanban Cloud for automatic pull request tracking, code review integration, and seamless workflow between issues and code.

## What GitHub Integration Provides

With GitHub connected, you get:

- **Automatic PR tracking** - Pull requests appear linked to issues
- **PR status updates** - See if PRs are open, merged, or closed
- **Code review** - Review diffs and leave comments from Vibe Kanban
- **Repository sync** - Your GitHub repos are available for workspaces


## Setting Up GitHub Integration

GitHub integration is configured at the organisation level. All projects in the organisation share the connection.

### Installing the GitHub App

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Organisation Settings">
  Click the gear icon (<Icon icon="gear" />) next to your organisation name, or go to **Settings** → **Organisation**.
</Step>

<Step title="Find GitHub Integration">
  Scroll to the **GitHub Integration** section.

</Step>

<Step title="Click Install GitHub App">
  Click **Install GitHub App**. You'll be redirected to GitHub.
</Step>

<Step title="Select repositories">
  On GitHub, choose which repositories to grant access to:

  - **All repositories** - Grant access to all current and future repos
  - **Only select repositories** - Choose specific repos


  <Tip>
  You can change repository access later in your GitHub settings.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Click Install">
  Click **Install** (or **Install & Authorize**). You'll be redirected back to Vibe Kanban.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify connection">
  Back in Vibe Kanban, the GitHub Integration section should show your connected account.

</Step>
</Steps>

### Enabling Code Review

After installing the GitHub App, enable code review for your repositories:

<Steps>
<Step title="Find the repository list">
  In the GitHub Integration section, you'll see a list of connected repositories.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable code review">
  Toggle **Enable Code Review** for each repository you want to use.

</Step>

<Step title="Bulk enable (optional)">
  Click **Enable All** to turn on code review for all repositories at once.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Code review allows Vibe Kanban to fetch pull request diffs and display them in the interface. Without it enabled, you'll only see basic PR metadata.
</Info>

## Using GitHub Integration

### Viewing Linked Pull Requests

When a pull request is linked to an issue, it appears in the issue panel:


The PR card shows:
- **PR title** - The pull request title
- **Status** - Open, merged, or closed
- **Branch** - Source and target branches
- **Review status** - Approved, changes requested, or pending

### Opening PRs in GitHub

Click the PR card or the **View on GitHub** link to open the pull request on GitHub in a new tab.

### Reviewing Code

If code review is enabled, you can review diffs directly in Vibe Kanban:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the issue">
  Click an issue that has a linked pull request.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Review">
  Click the **Review** button on the PR card.

</Step>

<Step title="Review the diff">
  Browse changed files and review the code. You can:
  - Navigate between files
  - See additions (green) and deletions (red)
  - Leave inline comments
</Step>
</Steps>

## How PRs Get Linked

Pull requests are automatically linked to issues when:

1. **Branch naming** - The branch name contains the issue Simple ID (e.g., `feature/TASK-123-add-login`)
2. **PR title** - The PR title contains the issue Simple ID
3. **Workspace** - A PR is created from a workspace linked to the issue

<Tip>
For automatic linking, include the issue ID in your branch name. For example, if you're working on TASK-42, name your branch `TASK-42-description` or `feature/TASK-42`.
</Tip>

## Managing GitHub Integration

### Changing Repository Access

To add or remove repositories from the GitHub App:

1. Go to [github.com/settings/installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)
2. Find "Vibe Kanban" in the list
3. Click **Configure**
4. Modify repository access
5. Click **Save**

Changes take effect immediately in Vibe Kanban.

### Disconnecting GitHub

To remove the GitHub integration entirely:

1. Go to [github.com/settings/installations](https://github.com/settings/installations)
2. Find "Vibe Kanban"
3. Click **Configure**
4. Scroll down and click **Uninstall**

<Warning>
Disconnecting GitHub removes all PR links and disables code review for the organisation. You can reinstall later, but you'll need to set up repository access again.
</Warning>

## Permissions Required

The Vibe Kanban GitHub App requests these permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Repository contents** (read) | Read code for diff display |
| **Pull requests** (read/write) | Track PRs and their status |
| **Metadata** (read) | Basic repository information |

<Info>
Vibe Kanban cannot push code, create branches, or modify your repository contents. It only reads data for display and tracking.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="GitHub App installation failed">
**Possible causes:**
- You don't have admin access to the GitHub organisation
- Third-party app restrictions are enabled

**Solutions:**
1. Ask an organisation admin to install the app
2. Check if your organisation has app installation restrictions
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Repositories not showing up">
**Possible causes:**
- Repository access wasn't granted during installation
- The repository was added after installation

**Solutions:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Applications → Vibe Kanban → Configure
2. Add the missing repositories
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PRs not linking automatically">
**Possible causes:**
- Branch name doesn't include the issue ID
- Issue ID format doesn't match (check for typos)
- GitHub integration isn't connected

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure your branch name contains the exact issue ID (e.g., `TASK-123`)
2. Check that GitHub integration shows as connected
3. Try adding the issue ID to the PR title
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code review not available">
**Possible causes:**
- Code review isn't enabled for the repository
- The repository doesn't have read access

**Solutions:**
1. Go to Organisation Settings → GitHub Integration
2. Enable "Code Review" for the repository
3. If it's not in the list, add repository access in GitHub
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Not authorized' error">
**Possible causes:**
- Your GitHub session expired
- You don't have access to the repository on GitHub

**Solutions:**
1. Sign out and sign back in
2. Verify you have access to the repository on GitHub
